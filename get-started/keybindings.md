You can now see all the available commands that you can set a keybinding. You can fuzzy search them by the input box. Click on the row of the command you want to add to change a keybinding. It will have a popup box that shows the name of the command. Simply type in the key you want to bind to the command. Click cancel to cancel the process and save to save the keybinding. To remove a keybinding from a command, simply leave the popup box blank and click save.
